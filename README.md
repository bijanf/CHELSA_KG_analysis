# CHELSA_KG_analysis
A program to analyze the changes of Koepen Climate categories in Central Asia using the CHELSA dataset

- I will use the kg2 based on Peel et al. 2007 , which is often recommended. It uses modern data and is widely recognized in the scientific community.
- Here is how the numbers of categoris in the input file correspond to the KÃ¶ppen-Geiger classes:

    1: Af - Equatorial fully humid\n
    2: Am - Equatorial monsoonal
    3: As - Equatorial summer dry
    4: Aw - Equatorial winter dry
    5: BWk - Cold desert
    6: BWh - Hot desert
    7: BSk - Cold steppe
    8: BSh - Hot steppe
    9: Cfa - Warm temperate fully humid hot summer
    10: Cfb - Warm temperate fully humid warm summer
    11: Cfc - Warm temperate fully humid cool summer
    12: Csa - Warm temperate summer dry hot summer
    13: Csb - Warm temperate summer dry warm summer
    15: Cwa - Warm temperate winter dry hot summer (Note: There is no number 14 in your list; it might be missing or not present in the dataset.)
    17: Cwc - Warm temperate winter dry cool summer
    19: Dfb - Snow fully humid warm summer
    23: Dsb - Snow summer dry warm summer
    24: Dsc - Snow summer dry cool summer
    25: Dsd - Snow summer dry extremely continental
    26: Dwa - Snow winter dry hot summer
    27: Dwb - Snow winter dry warm summer
    28: Dwc - Snow winter dry cool summer
    29: Dwd - Snow winter dry extremely continental
    30: ET - Polar tundra
    31: EF - Polar frost (assuming this continues as EF based on the pattern)
